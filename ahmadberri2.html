        <h2>Facts About Sea Turtles</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>All seven species are considered threatened or endangered.</li>
          <li>
            It is estimated that only one out of 1,000 hatchlings survives to be
            an adult.
          </li>
          <li>
            The sex of sea turtles, like other reptiles, depends on the
            temperature in the nest.
          </li>
          <li>Sea turtles donâ€™t have a favorite food</li>
          <li>
            Some sea turtles migrate very long distances while others stay close
            to home.

        <p>
          Two species of sea turtle breed in Lebanon and swim off the coast.
          Both are highly endangered, internationally, and within the East
          Mediterranean just a relic population remains. Never the less they are
          still with us and breed on southern beaches where development has not
          been as heavy as along other areas of the national coast line, such as
          Tyre Coast Nature Reserve and at the Palm Islands Nature Reserve.
          Although the centre of conservation efforts, both species are highly
          vulnerable. They still face the threats of dynamite fishing,
          ensnarement in nets, loss of breeding habitat and death from
          pollution. Many turtles die each year, for example, by eating plastic
          bags that look like their jelly fish prey.

        <h3 id="green-turtles">Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas)</h3>
        <p>
          Female Green Turtles lay up to 240 eggs in excavated nests on sandy
          beaches above the high tide line, hauling themselves up the beaches
          every third year to lay. After hatching under the sand the baby
          turtles (like the one left) dig themselves out and make a dash for the
          sea where they will spend the rest of their lives eating mostly sea
          grasses and algae and marine invertebrates.

        <p>
          Young Loggerheads will spend time in the shallows but as an adult they
          typically inhabit the open ocean and are capable of diving very deep
          feeding on jelly fish and fish.

        <p>
          Strong swimmers, the Stripe Necked Turtle live in lakes, rivers,
          ditches and wetlands. Although it is quite tolerant of all sorts of
          water bodies it needs some permanent water through the year to
          survive. Hence the best places to see them are in the wetlands of the
          Bekaa or muddy rivers. It is omnivorous eating live and dead animals
          such as fish, mollusks, insects and amphibians but also plant
          material. They spend long periods hauled out of the water, often in
          groups, but disturb them and plop! They are under the water for
          several minutes. Best time to see them is in the autumn when permanent
          water bodies shrink and many congregate at favored sites.
