        <h2>Facts</h2>
        <p>
          Six of the seven species of sea turtles that swim the planet’s
          waters—<u>leatherback</u>, loggerhead, Kemp’s ridley, green,
          <u>olive ridley</u>, and <u>hawksbill</u>—are found in every ocean
          except the Arctic and Antarctic. The seventh, the flatback, lives only
          in the waters around Australia. The leatherback is the largest sea
          turtle and can weigh a whopping 2,000 pounds. It’s also the only sea
          turtle that doesn’t have a hard, bony shell. Its carapace is somewhat
          flexible and almost rubbery to the touch. The shells of other sea
          turtles are made of <u>thick plates called scutes</u>.

        <h3>Turtle journeys</h3>
        <p>
          Sea turtles make incredibly long migrations between feeding and
          breeding areas. The leatherback travels an average of 3,700 miles each
          way. Sea turtles mate at sea, then come ashore on beaches to lay their
          eggs. Females dig a hole in the sand, then deposit their clutch of
          eggs (up to 100, in the leatherback’s case), cover it back up, then
          return to the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          After about 60 days, the eggs hatch and tiny hatchlings make their way
          from the nest to the water at night, often a deadly ordeal as
          seabirds, crabs, and other predators prey on the young turtles.
          Another threat comes from coastal development. Natural light at the
          horizon guides the hatchings to the ocean. Lights from hotels, homes,
          and other buildings can confuse the turtles into heading the wrong
          way.

        <h3>Extreme threats</h3>
        <p>
          Six of the seven sea turtle species are classified as threatened,
          endangered, or critically endangered, due largely to human impact in
          the form of hunting, bycatch in fishing nets, pollution, and climate
          change. Climate change affects the turtles by warming the temperature
          of the sand that sea turtle eggs are laid in, which in turn affects
          the outcome of the hatchlings’ sex.
